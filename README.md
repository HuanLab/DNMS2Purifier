DNMS2Purifier is a bioinformatic solution that purifies chimeric MS/MS spectra from LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics in Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mode.

The R script [DNMS2Purifier.r](https://github.com/HuanLab/DNMS2Purifier/blob/main/DNMS2Purifier.R) is the main program for MS/MS purification, we also provide the script [DNMS2Purifier_model_generation.r](https://github.com/HuanLab/DNMS2Purifier/blob/main/DNMS2Purifier_model_generation.R) for customized model training.

The program is written in R (ver 4.2.1).
