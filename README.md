# DNMS2Purifier
DNMS2Purifier is a machine learning-based (XGBoost) bioinformatic solution to purify the chimeric MS/MS spectra collected in DDA-based LC-MS/MS untargeted metabolomics.
The R script [DNMS2Purifier.r](https://github.com/HuanLab/DNMS2Purifier/blob/main/DNMS2Purifier.R) is the main program for MS/MS purification, we also provide the script [DNMS2Purifier_model_generation.r](https://github.com/HuanLab/DNMS2Purifier/blob/main/DNMS2Purifier_model_generation.R) for customized model retraining.

The program is written in R (ver 4.2.1). All source codes are publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/HuanLab/DNMS2Purifier).
